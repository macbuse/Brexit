# Brexit

Friends, Europeans, countrymen, lend me your ears;<br>
I come to bury Europe, not to praise it.<br>
The evil that treaties do lives after them;<br>
The good is oft interred with their ideals;<br>
So let it be with Europe. The noble Brexiteer<br>
Hath told you Europe was ambitious:<br>
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br>
And grievously hath Europe answer’d it.<br>
Here, under leave of the Brexiteer and the rest–<br>
For the Brexiteer is an honourable man;<br>
So are they all, all honourable men–<br>
Come I to speak in Europe’s funeral.<br>
He was my ally, faithful and just to me:<br>
But the Brexiteer says he was ambitious;<br>
And the Brexiteer is an honourable man.<br>
He hath brought many functionares home to Brussels<br>
Whose salaries did the general coffers empty:<br>
Did this in Europe seem ambitious?<br>
When that the poor have cried, Europe hath wept:<br>
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br>
Yet the Brexiteer says he was ambitious;<br>
And the Brexiteer is an honourable man.<br>
You all did see that on the Lupercal (?)<br>
I thrice presented Europe a federal mandate,<br>
Which was thrice refused: was this ambition?<br>
Yet the Brexiteer says he was ambitious;<br>
And, sure, Europe is an honourable ideal.<br>
I speak not to disprove what the Brexiteer spoke,<br>
But here I am to speak what I do know.<br>
You all did love the ideal once, not without cause:<br>
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for it?<br>
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br>
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;<br>
My heart is in the coffin there with Europe,<br>
And I must pause till it come back to me.
