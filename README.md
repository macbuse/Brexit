# Brexit

Friends, Europeans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Europe, not to praise it.
The evil that treaties do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their ideals;
So let it be with Europe. The noble Brexiteer
Hath told you Europe was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Europe answer’d it.
Here, under leave of the Brexiteer and the rest–
For the Brexiteer is an honourable man;
So are they all, all honourable men–
Come I to speak in Europe’s funeral.
He was my ally, faithful and just to me:
But the Brexiteer says he was ambitious;
And the Brexiteer is an honourable man.
He hath brought many functionares home to Brussels
Whose salaries did the general coffers empty:
Did this in Europe seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Europe hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet the Brexiteer says he was ambitious;
And the Brexiteer is an honourable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal (?)
I thrice presented Europe a federal mandate,
Which was thrice refused: was this ambition?
Yet the Brexiteer says he was ambitious;
And, sure, Europe is an honourable ideal.
I speak not to disprove what the Brexiteer spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love the ideal once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for it?
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Europe,
And I must pause till it come back to me.
